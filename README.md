# ⚽ Football Match Simulation 

Think you can't enjoy a football match through a console? Think again!

This interactive console-based application, written in C#, brings the thrill of a football match right to your terminal. With random events, realistic game details, and vibrant descriptions of the match, you'll be on the edge of your seat! 

## 📝 What It Does 

The Football Match Simulation simulates a football (soccer) match between two teams. Here's what's under the hood:

- The simulation creates two teams, each with a coach and 11 players with different attributes like Name, Age, and Height.
- The Referee and Assistant Referees are not forgotten—they are right there, keeping an eye on the match.
- Once the whistle blows, the goals start coming! Each goal, complete with scoring player details and the minute it was scored, gets recorded.
- The game follows real-world logic: the sequence of goals is not predictable, making every simulation run unique and exciting!
- When the final whistle blows, the console displays a timeline of the goals, the final score, and announces the winner—or a draw if the teams are equally talented.
